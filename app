To create a binary executable from a shell script using Perl, you can use a Perl wrapper approach, where the shell script is embedded in a Perl program. Here’s how to do it:

1. Embed the Shell Script in Perl

	1.	First, put your shell script as a multi-line string in a Perl file.
	2.	Then, use Perl to write the script to a temporary file, make it executable, and execute it.

Here’s an example:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Temp 'tempfile';
use File::chmod;

# Your shell script embedded in Perl
my $shell_script = <<'END_SCRIPT';
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello from the shell script!"
# Add your shell script content here
END_SCRIPT

# Create a temporary file to store the shell script
my ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();
print $fh $shell_script;
close $fh;

# Make the script executable
chmod 0755, $filename;

# Execute the script
system($filename);

# Clean up
unlink $filename;

2. Save and Run

	1.	Save this Perl script as script_wrapper.pl.
	2.	Make it executable:

chmod +x script_wrapper.pl


	3.	Run the script:

./script_wrapper.pl



3. Compile the Perl Script into a Binary

To create a binary executable from the Perl script, you can use PAR::Packer, which allows you to compile Perl scripts into standalone binaries.
	1.	Install PAR::Packer if it’s not already installed:

cpan install PAR::Packer


	2.	Use pp to compile the Perl script:

pp -o script_binary script_wrapper.pl



This will produce a standalone binary named script_binary. When executed, it will run the embedded shell script as if it were a native binary.
