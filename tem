**Subject: Addressing Connectivity Issues for NEON South Central MySQL DB with DSLA EventHub**

While onboarding DLSA for onboarded applications, we are encountering a connectivity issue between the NEON South Central MySQL DB and the eastus2/westus2 DSLA EventHub, due to the DSLA infrastructure being located in eastus2/westus2. For MySQL diagnostic settings, the EventHub namespace needs to be in the same region as the monitored resource if it is regional.

We had a call with the DSLA team regarding this issue. They plan to discuss with their management next week the possibility of setting up a SouthCentral EventHub. This solution involves an associated cost and will require time to set up the entire environment in SouthCentral.

In the interim, I have proposed the following temporary solution: We can configure the MySQL DB diagnostics with our existing EventHub, and the DSLA team will create a private endpoint from their subscription with a DLSA consumer group. This approach will ensure that the onboarded application complies with CSO requirements until the DSLA team provides a permanent solution.

The drawback of this solution is that it will increase the injection cost for our EventHub.

I have already reviewed this proposal with @BUNJAMIN, ANDRY, and he is good with this solution.

@ATUKURI, NAVEEN, are we okay with the increased injection cost, or should we wait until the DSLA team provides SouthCentral connectivity?
