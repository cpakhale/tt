Hi Swapna/Trupti,

After further investigation, I found that the logs from the astra-cso-att namespace are being sent to both the ContainerLog and fluentbit tables. I noticed that the astra-cso-att namespace was not included in the exclude list in the container-azm config. I have now added it to the configmap.

Regarding the fluentbit filter, we attempted to apply it in the non-production environment, but it did not reflect as expected. We have opened a defect for this issue, and Hong is currently looking into it.
