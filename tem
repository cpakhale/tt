1) The temporary fix will address the following scenarios. However, if the application stores AAF certificates via container/pod, the AZ CLI command/code will need to be updated to set an expiration date.

- Set an expiration date (365 days) for secrets/keys that either do not have an expiry set or have an expiry date exceeding 365 days.
- Create a new version for secrets that have not been rotated in the last 60 days (e.g., MySQL host secret).
- Even if AAF passwords have their own expiry, they still need to be set in the Key Vault. It is recommended to use the same expiry as AAF.
- For Postgres Database / MySQL Database secrets: As a temporary fix, our pipeline will handle setting the expiry date. Additionally, we are enhancing the OB pipeline to automatically set expiration dates when creating secrets and applying policies to enforce this practice.

**Action Required from the Application Team/Developers:** We have observed that many applications are storing AAF certificates via AZ CLI from the application container without an expiry date. Please update the AZ CLI command/code to set an expiration date, ensuring that the expiration date for secrets or keys does not exceed 365 days.
