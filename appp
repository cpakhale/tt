Hi Prabhu,

Currently, no applications are using Ultra Disk in the MCOM and NSAS environments. However, Ultra Disk is provisioned on each node in the AKS cluster, and we are being charged by Azure for these resources, even though they are not in use.

We have already removed the provision of Ultra Disk from the Y node pool. To implement the same change on the X node pool, we need to vacate all applications from the X node pool.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
