Dear Shobha,

Thank you so much for your kind words. It has been a pleasure working with the INLAP team, and I'm glad to have been able to assist with setting up the neon environments and addressing the CSO mandates. Your appreciation means a lot to me. 

Collaboration and teamwork are key to our success, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to support you, even during late hours. It’s rewarding to know that my efforts have made a positive impact, and I truly feel like a part of the INLAP family.

Thank you once again for your appreciation and support. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Best regards,
