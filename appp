To set the GroupID value to 3000 for the storage class `openebs-no-replica-wx`, we need to recreate the storage class. This requires destroying all application PVCs currently using the `openebs-no-replica-wx` storage class.

Please delete the application PVCs using the `openebs-no-replica-wx` storage class so that we can proceed with the reinstallation.

Thank you.
