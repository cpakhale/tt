Certainly! Hereâ€™s a rephrased version of your content:

Yes, we do have pipeline automation available for golden image updates. Here are some key points to consider:
	1.	Currently, Astrix processes one VM at a time, while the MCOM pipeline can handle multiple VMs within a single build pipeline.
	2.	According to the Astrix documentation, OS updates involve replacing the OS disk, which wipes out all installed software. Users are required to reinstall software manually. In contrast, the MCOM pipeline leverages the Chef extension to automatically reinstall software during the update process.
	3.	If a new image contains defects (a scenario observed in the past), Astrix does not support reverting to an older version. However, the MCOM pipeline enables reverting to any specific image version.
	4.	When VMs are created using specific image versions via Terraform or the ADO Stratum pipeline, the Astrix automated golden image process can diverge from the Terraform state. This may lead to issues when applications attempt to make changes to VMs through Terraform or the ADO Stratum pipeline.
	5.	The MCOM pipeline supports scheduling golden image updates, while Astrix allows only limited users with special access to perform actions on its platform. On the other hand, MCOM provides granular permissions, enabling application teams to perform golden image updates as needed.

Let me know if further refinements are needed!
