Todayâ€™s platform changes are non-disruptive to the application and should not have any impact. However, in the future, I recommend avoiding scheduling conflicting CRs with platform MW changes. This is why we previously suggested adding the ATT-IT-TD-SDE-TAM-OPS group to the CR approval process, allowing them to review changes and prevent conflicts.
