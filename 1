We typically aim to stay up to date with the latest tag implementations in the production environment, but due to the extended CRP window and dependencies on the TAM proxy application, we have fallen behind in production. To address this, weâ€™re planning to include multiple tags in a single change request (CR). A CR is scheduled for tonight, and we will be deploying the mcomsidecarlog updates today.
