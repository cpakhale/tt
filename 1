We have begun migrating to Azure Active Directory (AAD) workload identities from AD pod-managed identities on the platform side in the non-production environment. If you encounter issues with the secretproviderclass during the SyncUP process from an ArgoCD application, ensure that your secretproviderclass is using the correct API version. The `apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1` is no longer supported with the new CSI driver; you need to replace it with `apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1` as a quick fix.
