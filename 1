We are experiencing an issue while uploading Anoopâ€™s cookbook for Nagios. I am working with Anoop to resolve this.

From the platform side, the Nagios configuration is complete, and we can see alerts on the Nagios dashboard for the non-production environment. Regarding production, I had a call with the Nagios team today. They informed me that the current Nagios production server (dstxvengos05-eth2.infra.aic.att.net) will be decommissioned next year due to a VMware issue. They are currently setting up a new production server (2/p41363.vci.att.com) and expect to onboard our production VMs on the new server by the end of next week.
