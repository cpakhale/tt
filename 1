For production, I spoke with the Nagios team, who informed me that the current Nagios production server (dstxvengos05-eth2.infra.aic.att.net) will be decommissioned next year due to a VMware issue. Although there was an initial plan to onboard to mcnjv9ngos02-eth2.mtcnj.aic.cip.att.com, this server lacks connectivity to our DCU production VMs. The team is now setting up a new production server (zlp41363.vci.att.com) and has confirmed connectivity with our DCU production server. They expect to onboard our production VMs to this new server by the end of next week.
