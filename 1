“Hi Kailas,
Whenever the application team triggers the namespace pipeline, it creates a new token for Vault, which affects the Vault pods. Anurag is currently working on a fix for the pipeline.
As a temporary workaround, I have disabled the Vault layer in the namespace pipeline to prevent further impact on Vault.”
