We received a delivery from the MCOM development team for the following fix in tag 13.7. We have scheduled a CR for tonight and will be deploying the mcomsidecarlog updates today to address the issue outlined below.

While we typically aim to stay current with the latest tag implementations in production, the extended CRP window and dependencies on the application for Temp Proxy (related to AKS proxy removal without a flash cut) have caused delays. To catch up, we plan to include multiple tags in a single change request (CR).
