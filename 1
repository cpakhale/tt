Will the Host Patching Update & Reboot activity be performed one host at a time, or will all hosts be down simultaneously? If all hosts are down at the same time, it could impact components in the K&S cluster.

We plan to start with the Middletown site during the following maintenance window. After verifying all applications post-patching, we will provide the next maintenance window.

Proposed Date: Thursday, 09/24
Duration: 3 PM - 7 PM PST
