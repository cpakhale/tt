We have begun migrating to Azure Active Directory (AAD) workload identities from AD pod-managed identities on the platform side in the non-production environment. If you encounter issues with the secretproviderclass during the SyncUP process from an ArgoCD application, ensure that your secretproviderclass is using the correct API version. The `apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1` is no longer supported with the new CSI driver; you need to replace it with `apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1` as a quick fix.

We have deployed the 12.5 tag and enabled the namespace pipeline for the shared dev environment to begin application migration to AAD workload identities. Applications need to run the namespace pipeline with the latest 12.5 tag, and OB-App's are expected to follow the steps listed in the Wiki for "CSI-Driver to Access KV within AKS-Pod - Using Workload Identity".
