“I collaborated with the Nagios team to resolve the host group issue on the dashboard and address login problems. All non-prod VMs are now visible on the dashboard, and I’m currently setting up Nagios alerts for the application using Anoop’s cookbook. I’ll need to coordinate with the Nagios team again to configure the dashboard for the new alerts. The Prod Nagios ticket is still pending, and I will update you once the setup for the non-prod environment is complete.”
