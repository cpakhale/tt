I worked with Hong to add the fluentbit namespace to the exclude list in the Fluentbit config on the nsas-westus2-p1a environment.

@SOLOMON, STEVEN J — Could you please verify from your side as well? Once confirmed, I’ll implement the same change on the eastus2 production environment.

@ANUMOLU, SWAPNA — I agree that we should set up alerting on Fluentbit, but we need to find an optimized way to send logs to LAW. Perhaps we can use Kibana rules to forward logs with more refined filtering.

We also need a deeper technical discussion about the log pattern below, as it’s a false alert. The message is informational but is incorrectly tagged with stderr. We’ll raise a defect to investigate this further.
