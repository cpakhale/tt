Ondrej reverted the ingress annotation from spec.ingressClassName: nginx (which was changed due to a Helm warning) back to kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx. As a result, it registered successfully with the ingress controller, and the application is now accessible. In the meantime, we have opened defect DEFECT-75473 with the Istio developer since kubernetes.io/ingress.class is deprecated in the new AKS version.
