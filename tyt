This subscription is a shared one that hosts multiple applications, each with a different mots ID. We have already implemented a shared MTA solution using MechID, but all application traffic is routed from dedicated MTA VMs to a shared MTA mailbox with MechID. This centralized solution is provided at the platform level, so applications do not need to onboard to the shared mailbox individually.
