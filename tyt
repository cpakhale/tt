“Hi Kailas,

This was completed before I went on OOO. Let me verify it again, as we might need to retest after the GitHub migration.

Today, I had a call with Louis, and it seems the KY secrets rules have changed again. Disabling old secrets with an expiry date is no longer sufficient. I believe we need to update and enhance our script before applying the cron job (PUPITER-3343) in the environment.

@Gurajapu, @Amar, do you have a point of contact who can clarify all the secrets rules/changes to ensure we aren’t missing anything?”
