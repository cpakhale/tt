Status on SNA1b:

There is a power outage in SNA1b, impacting DCAE services, including the SNA1b Consul.

We attempted to bring up the old WHPA (Consul DR site), but the cluster was not healthy. As a result, we decided to create a new cluster on WHPA, but the attempt failed due to an AIC DNS issue.

Subsequently, we started creating a new cluster on KGM1b. However, in the meantime, we managed to bring up the old WHPA (Consul DR site), and the DCAE team is now verifying it.
