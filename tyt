We have implemented the Istio Ambient version on the shared development environment, which required a few changes on the application side. During the troubleshooting session, the following solution was recommended, tested, and verified on one of the microservices. The NCaaS developer is now applying the same changes to all microservices for the NCaaS application in the development environment.
