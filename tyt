As discussed during the call, this will be a flash cut during the App Ob pipeline migration. In the meantime, we expect all applications to be ready with their GitHub repositories and prerequisites completed before the pipeline migration.

I have updated the timeline for the NSAS non-prod environment in the wiki page below, with the migration scheduled for February 10. A notification will also be sent with the maintenance window details.
