The Azure Virtual Machine (VM) sizes you’ve mentioned—Standard_D16s_v5 and Standard_D16s_v3—are part of Azure’s D-series, designed for general-purpose workloads. Here’s a comparison of their key specifications:

Specification	Standard_D16s_v5	Standard_D16s_v3
vCPUs	16	16
Memory	64 GiB	64 GiB
Processor	Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or 8473C (Sapphire Rapids)	Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake)
Max Network Interfaces (NICs)	8	8
Max Network Bandwidth	35,000 Mbps	16,000 Mbps
Max Remote Storage Throughput	2,600 MBps	768 MBps

Key Differences:
	•	Processor Generation: The D16s_v5 utilizes newer Intel® Xeon® processors (Ice Lake or Sapphire Rapids), offering improved performance and efficiency over the older Skylake processors in the D16s_v3.
	•	Network Bandwidth: The D16s_v5 provides a significantly higher maximum network bandwidth (35,000 Mbps) compared to the D16s_v3’s 16,000 Mbps, which can be beneficial for network-intensive applications.
	•	Storage Throughput: The maximum remote storage throughput is higher in the D16s_v5 (2,600 MBps) compared to the D16s_v3 (768 MBps), allowing for faster data access and storage operations.

Both VM sizes offer the same number of vCPUs and memory, making them suitable for general-purpose workloads such as web servers, application servers, and small to medium databases. However, the D16s_v5’s enhanced network and storage capabilities, along with its newer processor architecture, may provide better performance for more demanding applications.
